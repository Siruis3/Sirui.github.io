## 👋 Hi, I’m **Sirui Lyu**

🎓 I’m currently an MPhil student in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong  
🧑‍🏫 Supervised by [**Professor Heming Cui**](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/heming) (PhD, Columbia University), Associate Professor at HKU  
🔬 My research focuses on **building strongly-consistent, reliable, and high-performance distributed software systems**, especially those designed for **enterprise-level deployment**  
💡 I’m particularly interested in the core infrastructure that powers distributed systems at scale — including fault tolerance, coordination, and security  
🛠 Beyond research, I’m experienced in designing and building **enterprise-grade backend systems**, including distributed coordination services, management platforms, and performance-critical components
